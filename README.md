# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Webpage created as a study guide for the UC Davis Coding Bootcamp pre-work.

The pre-work activity of creating a study guide webpage was a great introductory exercise for setting up the basic foundations for the rest of the bootcamp.
Building this webpage provided two main benefits, hands on learning by actually building the webpage and taking notes to retain information at the same time.
This activity provided an introduction to the developer mindset, computational thinking, and Agile. In addition, I learned some basics on how to use GitHub, how to create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and use them all together to put create a webpage.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide webpage is divided into four sections, HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each section lists some key takeaway notes that I found to be very helpful as I was learning each topic. I can also use this page to look at the console in Chrome Dev to see various development details such as JS running.
